This is a simple educational and experimental project for a fictional restaurant website. The website includes sections for offers, contact information, and a full menu â€” all built using only HTML and CSS.
**This project is based on a tutorial by [Mohamed Elkashef](https://www.youtube.com/@Mohamed.Elkashef)**
